&lt;h2>Software Developer and AI &amp;amp; Robotics Student Based in Stoke-on-Trent&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My name is Christopher Mead, or "Chris" for short. I'm currently in the sandwich year portion of my Bachelor's degree in &lt;em>AI &amp;amp; Robotics&lt;/em>, working at &lt;a href="https://aidenvi.com">AiDenVi&lt;/a> on a web application, using machine learning to generate technical files for electronic components. During my studies I've gained hands-on experience with everything from machine learning techniques, to natural language processing, to embedded systems programming, to project management and group work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brick Arch</title><link>https://chrismead.co.uk/projects/brickarch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrismead.co.uk/projects/brickarch/</guid><description>&lt;p>While working at &lt;em>H.G. Matthews&lt;/em>, a brickyard in Southeast England, I was tasked with solving the problem of the lengthy and time-consuming nature of creating accurate templates for use in the manufacturing of brick arches, which at the time were calculated and drawn manually in pencil. I developed a bespoke software solution capable of not only creating the requested templates, but also generating accurate, labelled technical drawings for providing customers a preview of exactly what they were paying for.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
