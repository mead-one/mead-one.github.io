      <description>&lt;section id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;While working at &lt;em&gt;H.G. Matthews&lt;/em&gt;, a brickyard in Southeast England, I was tasked with solving the problem of the lengthy and time-consuming nature of creating accurate templates for use in the manufacturing of brick arches, which at the time were calculated and drawn manually in pencil. I developed a bespoke software solution capable of not only creating the requested templates, but also generating accurate, labelled technical drawings for providing customers a preview of exactly what they were paying for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
